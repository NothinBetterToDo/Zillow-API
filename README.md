# Zillow API
 
This is a tutorial to search property results on the Zillow website through its API. We will be using RapidAPI, the world's largest API marketplace that makes it easier to connect to thousands of APIs including Zillow. 

In this tutorial, we create and use functions to ensure reusability. We search and extract multiple property listings and parse the results to a data frame. We also utilize beautiful soup package to scrape the data from the website.
